# Weather-Journal App Project

## Description

This web app queries a weather API by passing a ZIP code entered by the user. From the data returned by the website, temperature and other values are posted as an object on server side. That endpoint object is then fetched by client and UI is changed dynamically.

## Prerequisites

node - to install a local server
npm - to manage node packages
